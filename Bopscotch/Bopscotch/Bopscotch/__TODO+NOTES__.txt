Hi,

I was wondering if you would be interested in taking a look at Bopscotch - our (Leda Entertainment) latest release for Android.

Game features:
- Over 90 single player levels in "adventure" mode
- Cross platform real time two player "race" mode with three race circuits
- Customisable characters with unlockable costumes
- No adverts, no pay-to-win

Play store link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ledaentertainment.bopscotch

Bopscotch is a 2D platform runner game, but as well as the standard "jump to avoid obstacles" mechanic, the player also has a degree of control over the speed their character moves at. This adds an extra level of challenge to the genre as the player must speed up and slow down in order to navigate the obstruction on the course as quickly as possible, while collecting score-boosting items.

The feature that set Bopscotch apart from other games in this genre is the race mode. By connecting to wifi, players can link up and go head-to-head against each other in real time, regardless of what combination of operating systems their devices are running - so an Android owner could race against another player on another Android handset, or a Windows Phone, or iPhone or iPad. Currently the game has three race circuits, with further courses to be added in future updates (as well as addition single player levels and character costumes).

Bopscotch has a free trial mode featuring the first 30 single player levels and seven complete races on any of the three race circuits (ie: if the wifi connection is lost in mid race, a trial race will not be "used up"), with the full version costing £1.99GBP. This is a one off payment to unlock the full version: there are no in game adverts or microtransactions. A Windows Phone version is also available, and an iOS version is scheduled for launch in the near future.

The launch press pack can be downloaded from here - www.ledaentertainment.com/downloads/press/Bopscotch Android Launch PR.zip which contains image assets and links to the trailer and race mode demo videos.

If you need any further information, please let me know.

Kind regards,
Ben Pritchard



    

Bopscotch - platform runner with device-to-device real time racing now available for WP8

Hello,

Leda Entertainment are proud to announce the launch of Bopscotch - a 2D platform runner game with a puzzle element and two-player device-to-device racing in real time for Windows Phone 8.

The game's puzzle element comes from the ability of the player to control their "Bopper" character's speed (within limits), making the game more than just a test of reflexes and timing. There are over 90 single player levels in "Adventure" mode, while "Race" mode allows players to link up and race head to head in real time over local wifi - this feature also works cross-platform, so Windows Phone owners can race iPhone or Android owners as well as other Windows Phone owners!

The game also features customisable characters, with a number of costumes to unlock.

The game is free for the trial version, with the full version costing £1.99.
